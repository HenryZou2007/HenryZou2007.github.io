    <div class="dem-song-lyrics"><p class="song-lyrics">
First things first<br>
I'ma say all the words inside my head<br>
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh<br>
The way that things have been, oh ooh<br>
Second thing second<br>
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be<br>
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh<br>
The master of my sea, oh ooh<br>

    
I was broken from a young age<br>
Taking my sulking to the masses<br>
Write down my poems for the few<br>
That looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br>
Singing from heartache from the pain<br>
Taking my message from the veins<br>
Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
Seeing the beauty through the<br>
    
    
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
(Pain, pain)<br>
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
(Pain)<br>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br>
(Pain)<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
Third things third<br>
Send a prayer to the ones up above<br>
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh<br>
Your spirit up above, oh ooh<br>
I was choking in the crowd<br>
Building my rain up in the cloud<br>
Falling like ashes to the ground<br>
Hoping my feelings, they would drown<br>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
Inhibited, limited<br>
'Til it broke up and it rained down<br>
It rained down, like<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
(Pain, pain)<br>
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer<br>
(Pain)<br>
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br>
(Pain)<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
Last things last<br>
By the grace of the fire and the flames<br>
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh<br>
The blood in my veins, oh ooh<br>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
Inhibited, limited<br>
'Til it broke up and it rained down<br>
It rained down, like<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
(Pain, pain)<br>
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer<br>
(Pain)<br>
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br>
(Pain)<br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
